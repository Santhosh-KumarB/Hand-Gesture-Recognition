# Hand Gesture Recognition 🖐️🤖

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship – Task 04**.

It demonstrates how a **deep learning image classification model** can be integrated into a **Flask web application** to recognize hand gestures from uploaded images.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload hand gesture images (PNG / JPG)
- Displays the uploaded image on the UI
- Predicts the hand gesture using a trained CNN model
- Clean and simple web interface
